A Caltrain hit a car last night. There were delays. I recorded [21 minutes](https://cdn.rawgit.com/alecglassford/blog.alec.casa/3771188ac8079373e8b9a9c9c42e9e54c4ce61b9/big-files/train-delay.mp3) of my train experience. This is unedited: it's lazy audio. But maybe you'll find it oddly soothing, as I do. Beware of the sudden train noises that come on loud and quick, though. (e.g. 3:25). <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://cdn.rawgit.com/alecglassford/blog.alec.casa/3771188ac8079373e8b9a9c9c42e9e54c4ce61b9/big-files/train-delay.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="1292000" data-plays="1">Have a listen.</span>
