A Caltrain hit a car last night. There were delays. I recorded [21 minutes](/media/train-delay.mp3) of my train experience. This is unedited: it's lazy audio. But maybe you'll find it oddly soothing, as I do. Beware of the sudden train noises that come on loud and quick, though. (e.g. 3:25). Have a listen.
